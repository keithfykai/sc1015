    "(a) Print the Classification Tree of max depth 4 that you fit in Problem 1(a). Note that each leaf node of your tree represents a specific partition of your training data, based on certain conditions given by the splits in the tree. Find out which leaf node of this tree has the highest number of False Positives (FP) in the training dataset and print all samples in the Train set (rows from the dataframe) that end up in this leaf node (partition) during fit.\n",
